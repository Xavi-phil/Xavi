Simulating Social Network Diffusion Process IC and LT on a Graph and choosing a set of initial seeds for maximum information Spreading

LT model ought to be checked for bugs.

The analysis was performed for Random Graph, Scale-Free Graph and a Facebook Graph.

For information on how to simulate a Scale-Free Graph , look at the following website:
